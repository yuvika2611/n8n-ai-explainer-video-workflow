# n8n AI Agent Workflow

This workflow automates the process of generating a full short video ‚Äî from script to final MP4 ‚Äî with the help of AI tools.

## Features

- **Scriptwriting**: Uses OpenRouter (Mistral-7B) to generate a 10-scene explainer script with caption, hashtags, and narration text.
- **Visual Extraction**: Pulls out the `Visuals:` lines from the script to use as prompts.
- **Image Generation**: Sends each scene description to Stability AI‚Äôs Stable Diffusion XL to create high-quality 1024√ó1024 images.
- **Voiceover**: Converts the narration text into speech with ElevenLabs and saves it as MP3.
- **Video Assembly**: Uses FFmpeg to merge all images with the narration into a single MP4 video.
